# Cocoon Font Installer

Yo! Built this quick Magisk/KernalSU module to get that sweet Cocoon font on your Android. No system mods, no hassle. Flash and enjoy! 🚀

## How to Get Rolling 🔧
1. Grab the zip from [releases](https://github.com/yadavnikhil03/Cocoon-Font/releases/tag/release_v1.0)
2. Open Magiskor KernalSU and flash it
3. Quick reboot
4. Boom! Fresh fonts!

## What's Cool About It ⚡
- Clean systemless install (no system partition mess)
- Runs smooth on Android 10+
- Works with Magiskor KernalSu

## Something Not Right? 🤔
- Font looking weird? Clear that cache
- Update Magisk if things are funky
- Got other font modules? They might be fighting
